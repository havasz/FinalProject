# Szarafinski_FinalProject
Design my own video game for my Intro to Programming and Design course
The game is multiplayer with one person controling a helicopter with WASD and another controling a ship with left/right arrow keys
Both the players can shoot and they are being attacked by drones and small boats
The goal is to defend the ship because the drones and boats are primarily going to try to sink the ship
The difficulty increases with the level and the game is infinite
You have a set health and the game tracks your points and displays your highest score
